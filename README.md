<h2>My first mission: The controlplane node in our cluster is planned for a regular maintenance reboot tonight. While we do not anticipate anything to go wrong, we are required to take the necessary backups. Take a snapshot of the ETCD database using the built-in snapshot functionality. Store the backup file at location /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db</h2>

My next task: Wake up! We have a conference call! After the reboot the master nodes came back online, but none of our applications are accessible. Check the status of the applications on the cluster. What's wrong?

Nothing is present!
Luckily we took a backup. Restore the original state of the cluster using the backup file.
Lets first verify the snapshot:
